This project is just a bunch of one-liners that solve some simple task in Linux.

1. `text2pdf` converts a text file to pdf.
2. `view` is just passes its arguments to vim calling in read-only mode.
3. `winproc` shows the name of the process the selected window belongs to.
4. `whatshell.sh` contains a function that I used to figure out difference between login and interactive shells.
